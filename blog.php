		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
			<p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.
                            It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his 
                            favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 
                            17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded 
                            on three sides by a crenellated wall.Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work 
                            continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.<br> <br>The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been 
                            completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020
                            would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $956 million). The construction project employed some 20,000
                            artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.<br><br>
                            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and 
                            one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example
                            of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7‚Äì8 million visitors a year and 
                            in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000‚Äì2007) initiative.</p>

                            The form of Shiva's consort Parvati worshipped at this temple is called Karpagambal is from Tamil ("Goddess of the Wish-Yielding Tree").
                            The temple was built around the 7th century CE and is an example of Dravidian architecture.<br><br>
                            According to the Puranas, Shakti worshipped Shiva in the form of a peacock, giving the vernacular name Mylai (MayilƒÅi) to the area that 
                            developed around the temple - mayil is Tamil for "peacock".Shiva is worshiped as Kapaleeswarar, and is represented by the lingam.
                            His consort Parvati is depicted as Karpagambal. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the 
                            Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.<br><br>The Kapaleeshwarar temple
                            is of typical Dravidian architectural style, with the gopuram overpowering the street on which the temple sits. This temple is
                            also a testimonial for the vishwakarmas sthapathis. There are two entrances to the temple marked by the gopuram on either side. The
                            east gopuram is about 40 m high, while the smaller western gopuram faces the sacred tank.</p>

                            The gurdwara is built around a man-made pool that was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.
                            In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib.The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by 
                            the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading 
                            Afghan armies.Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, 
                            and overlaid the sanctum with Gold foil in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.</p>

		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
			<p>Jaisalmer , nicknamed "The Golden city", is a city in the Indian state of Rajasthan, located 575 kilometres (357 mi) 
                            west of the state capital Jaipur. The town stands on a ridge of yellowish sandstone and is crowned by the ancient
                            Jaisalmer Fort. This fort contains a royal palace and several ornate Jain temples. Many of the houses and temples 
                            of both the fort and of the town below are built of finely sculptured sandstone. The town lies in the heart of the 
                            Thar Desert (the Great Indian Desert) and has a population, including the residents of the fort, of about 78,000.
                            It is the administrative headquarters of Jaisalmer District. Jaisalmer was once the capital of Jaisalmer State.<br><br>
                            Jaisalmer, being an arid desert region, is prone to extremes in terms of temperature. The temperature varies greatly 
                            from day to night in both summer and winter. The maximum summer temperature is around 49 ¬∞C (120 ¬∞F) while the minimum 
                            is 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F). The maximum winter temperature is usually around 23.6 ¬∞C (74.5 ¬∞F) and the minimum is 5 ¬∞C (41 ¬∞F).</p>

		  </div>
		  <div class="modal-body">
			<p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal
                            Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his 
                            capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, 
                            who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines 
                            Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.<br><br>The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during 
                            Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished
                            by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress 
                            was subsequently used as a garrison.</p>

		  <div class="modal-body">
			<p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai, India. It was erected 
                            to commemorate the landing in December 1911 at Ramchandani Road near Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Chowk in Mumbai.<br><br>
                            The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating elements 
                            of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only
                            in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a triumphal arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres
                            (85 feet) high.It is an effort from the architect George Wittet.</p>
